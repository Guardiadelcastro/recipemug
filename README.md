# RecipeMug
Recipe Mug is a fullstack learning project. It is an web app to create, store, update, and delete your own recipes. 

We have used Vue for the frontend and Express with Typescript for the backend, MongoDB as our database and Nginx for our debian server. 

We aim to continue developing the app as we learn more and we have new ideas.
